Sorry I don't have a GitHub page but you probably need a PhD to get an Angular application to run correctly on GH pages.
If you want to see the website, follow these steps.

1. git clone https://github.com/KuenzliJ/portfolio-page/
2. change to the folder /portfolioPage
3. npm install
4. ng serve --open
