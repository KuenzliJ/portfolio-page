Sorry I don't have a GitHub page but you probably need a PhD to get an Angular application to run correctly on GH pages.
If you want to see the website, follow these steps.

1. Clone the Repo
   `git clone https://github.com/KuenzliJ/portfolio-page/`
2. Change to the folder where the application is
   `cd portfolio-page/portfolioPage`
3. Install the necessary modules
   `npm install`
4. Open the Website on your localhost
   `ng serve --open`
5. Enjoy
