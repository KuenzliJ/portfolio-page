Sorry I don't have a github page but I just can't get it to work even after hours of trial and error.
If you want to see the website, follow these steps.

1. Clone the Repo<br>
   `git clone https://github.com/KuenzliJ/portfolio-page/`
2. Change to the folder where the application is <br>
   `cd portfolio-page/portfolioPage`
3. Install the necessary modules <br>
   `npm install`
4. Open the Website on your localhost <br>
   `ng serve --open`
5. Enjoy
